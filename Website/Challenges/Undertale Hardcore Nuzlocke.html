 <h1> The Rules to the Undertale and Deltarune Hardcore Nuzlocke </h1>
 <p><div id="cen"> Suggested by NatDaGreat4455 </div></p>
 <ol>
  <li> You must beat ALL routes of that game (Undertale: Neutral, Pacifist, Genocide)(Deltarune. True Pacifist, Full Massacre, Snowgrave)					</li>
  <li> You must fight ALL ENEMY'S (including secret bosses and all encounters like gyftroot, mouse wheel ect.)								</li>											</li>
  <li> If you die once, you FULLY reset the run (meaning if I finished all of pacifist and died on massacre, I would have to delete BOTH saves and restart from the beginning)	</li>																																																													</li>																																																													</li>
  <li> You can't use any healing items IN BATTLE but you can use healing items outside of battle (all magic is allowed in battle including healing magic)			</li>
 </ol>
