  <li> You must fight ALL ENEMY'S (including secret bosses and all encounters like gyftroot, mouse wheel ect.)												</li>											</li>
  <li> If you die once, you FULLY reset the run (meaning if I finished all of pacifist and died on massacre, I would have to delete BOTH saves and restart from the beginning)(this includes both games)	</li>																																																													</li>																																																													</li>
  <li> You can't use any healing items IN BATTLE but you can use healing items outside of battle 														</li>
