 <h1> The Rules to the Undertale and Deltarune Nuzlocke </h1>
 <p><div id="cen"> Suggested by NatDaGreat4455 </div></p>
 <ol>
  <li> You must beat ALL routes of that game (meaning after a neutral run, you have to reset and then start pacifist or genocide) (Undertale: Neutral, Pacifist, Genocide) (Deltarune: True Pacifist, Full Massacre, Snowgrave)	</li>
  <li> You must fight ALL ENEMY'S (including secret bosses and all encounters like gyftrot, mouse wheel etc.)															</li>
  <li> If you die once, you FULLY reset the run (meaning if I finished all of pacifist and died on massacre, I would have to delete BOTH saves and restart from the beginning)							</li>
 </ol>
